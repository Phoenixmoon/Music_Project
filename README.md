# Music_Project

## Description
Generates a music mp3 from a txt file input. Note that notes must be typed in this format: A4_dotted_quarter, for instance. Flats would be Ab, whereas sharps use the word sharp, as in A_sharp_4_dotted_eighth. Additionally, notes should be separated by commas and a space; returns/line indents are not supported. Example accepted input: "C4_dotted_quarter, Bb5_whole, eighth_rest". If a note input, for whatever reason, fails, a short rest (silence) will be present in the mp3 file instead.

## Installation
Use the command pip to install the required librairies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


requirements.txt is attached to this project

## Usage
How to add examples? Links maybe to sample mp3s?
